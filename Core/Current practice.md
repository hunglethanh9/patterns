The marginal change required to move towards an ideal, compared to the absolute location of that ideal.  "Current practice" is the current absolute location.

When an ideal is in the middle of a spectrum, it's important not to get lost in a battle of the extremes, and instead figure out in which direction the ideal lies in relation to current practice, and move in that direction, being careful not to overshoot the mark.  It's about the marginal change, not the absolute position.
- Especially the case for unbounded spectra and when there's uncertainty in the location of the ideal.

When debating spectra, language is sometimes simplified to express the direction of the ideal from current practice, without making it explicit that that's what's being done.  Others might interpret it literally and think the absolute location is being advocated, and debate the extreme instead of the direction.  This is exacerbated when there's uncertainty in how far away the current practice is from the ideal.

Examples:
- "You can do anything you set your mind to." Absolutely? No. Relative to most people's self-assessment of their potential? Yes.
- "You can't judge a book by its cover."
- if somebody identifies themselves as "open-minded", it doesn't mean they'll entertain anything no matter how crazy, just that they consider themselves more open than average
- Bernie Sanders calling himself a socialist instead of just "more towards the socialist end of the spectrum than the US currently is"
