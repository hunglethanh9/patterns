When variables compensate for changes in other variables, in order to keep certain properties within acceptable tolerances.

Note that while the property being regulated won't change (or won't change as much as anticipated), the change in dependent variables will have their own effects.  E.g. even if a better programming language doesn't reduce the number of bugs (see below), it would likely reduce development time or some other variable.

There can be a delay between impulse and response
- e.g. first few minutes of running is hard, then gets easier as your body increases heart rate, converts stored energy into usable form, etc

Examples:
- risk compensation
	- start requiring seatbelts in cars, but fatalities don't decrease as much as expected because people drive more often, faster, etc (Peltzman effect)
	- [Shared spaces (Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_space): increasing perceived risk causes drivers to be more cautious, decreasing accidents
- use a better programming language, but number of defects doesn't decrease because bug fixing is only prioritized up to a fixed level of quality, regardless of how easy it is to reach that level
- more people in cities, so you'd expect it to be easier to meet people, but people become desensitized to being around others, which might partially or fully negate the effect
- biological systems (e.g. drug tolerance)
- hardware gets faster, software does more -> computer doesn't get faster
- terrorists changing their behavior in response to increased surveillance
- self-licensing: increased confidence and security in one's self-image or self-concept tends to make that individual worry less about the consequences of subsequent immoral behavior (Wikipedia)
