The selection of an appropriate model {interpretation} such that it accurately represents the subject while minimizing the model's complexity.

The first step in efficiently solving a problem {answering a question} is framing the problem in a way most likely to result in an effective solution.  If all available options are bad, it's possible that the problem is poorly framed. Sometimes a dilemma is not resolved by picking one of the alternatives, but by "backing out of" the dilemma by reevaluating the assumptions that created it.

"If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions." (Einstein, reportedly)

Physical analogy: a bunch of objects connected by strings and all jumbled up; attempt to untangle and pick up objects so that, when hanging, they fall in a nice, neat structure. {Need concrete example}

Looking at some physical object from different perspectives. From one angle, the object looks complex and random, so describing it would require a large amount of information. From another angle, the object looks very orderly and has a simple description.

Edge cases can be an indicator of an inappropriate model.  They mean that the model doesn't fit the subject at certain points, and could be a sign that the model has other inaccuracies that haven't yet been discovered.

Support vector machines: "an SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible." (Wikipedia)
- or classification algorithms in general

Examples:
- Arabic vs Roman numerals
- cartesian vs polar coordinates
- Pi is a complicated number, even though it's concept is simple. Two different representations for the same thing (C/2r, and 3.14159...); the number is just a reframing of the geometrical representation into a numerical one.
- Many aspects of human behavior can be viewed instructively through the lens of evolution.  For example, how we choose mates.
- (from "Model Thinking", Week 5, lecture 2): sum to 15 card game and tic tac toe as different framings of the same game
- assuming the earth to be the center of the solar system required the other planets to have complex orbits
	- or circular vs elliptical orbits
- those "3d" street paintings that only look correct from a certain angle
	- (from the wrong angle) "it's a cube distorted in such and such a way"
	- (from the right angle) "it's a cube"
- people grouped by country borders vs people grouped by ideology, culture, ethnicity, religion, etc (or not grouped at all)
	- countries don't always coincide with peoples

Reframing to resolve a dilemma:
- the debate about getters and setters vs public fields in OOP: the former introduces boilerplate, the latter allows for ad hoc modification of data; by using functional programming/immutable data this debate disappears
	- same with exceptions vs return codes: monads provide a way of conveniently dealing with return codes
- "thinking outside the box": reframing requires zooming out far enough to get perspective on the current frame ([meta](Levels.md))

Viewing things using inapt standards:
- taking a trip to the countryside and complaining about how terrible its cities are
- [hell in a handbasket](Ignorance.md#hell-in-a-handbasket)

{TODO: what is the relationship to [factorization](Abstraction.md#factorization)?}
- is factorization about the construction of a basis, whereas framing is about the discovery of an existing basis?
