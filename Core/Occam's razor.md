Out of all the theories that fit the evidence, the simplest theory should be preferred.

On the simple -> complex scale, the upward pressure (towards complex) is created by the fact that overly simple explanations just don't fit the evidence.  However, there's no inherent downward pressure.  An overly complex explanation will still fit the current evidence but is more likely to diverge from future evidence ([overfitting](Overfitting.md)).  This is due to the fact that the number of theories of a given complexity increases with the degree of complexity.  Therefore, the theory with the highest probability of being correct (i.e. the mode ([distributions](Distributions.md))) is the simplest one.

Principle of parsimony

Flying spaghetti monster: an alternative complex theory

[entropy](Entropy.md): the number of theories (microstates) of a given complexity (macrostate) increases with the degree of complexity; i.e. entropy increases with degrees of freedom


{Unify the following?}

A sufficiently broad {adaptable} theory can appear to explain phenomena.

Prediction, falsifiability, constraint of expectations

Examples:
- miracles
- string theory?
- the universe isn't governed by natural laws, it's managed by a supreme being
- "There's no way the program should be doing thatâ€”must be a compiler bug."


In uncertain (esp. complex) situations, there's bound to be aspects which fit a simple and plausible theory.  
Given phenomena, the ability to cherry pick aspects which fit an alternative theory.

Examples:
- conspiracy theories
