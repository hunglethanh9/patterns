Experiencing things yourself vs learning from others

Language doesn't have the bandwidth to efficiently communicate as much information as direct experience provides.

This isn't either be told it or learn it yourself through experience.  You can be pushed in a certain direction by what people tell you, and still learn it yourself through experience.  If you've been told it e.g. by someone you respect, you likely be quicker to learn it when you experience it. ([priming](Priming.md))

You can be told something, and be conscious of it. But sometimes a thing must be experienced in order to be grokked. ([forefront knowledge](Forefront knowledge.md))


### Filtering
Only exposing someone to some things vs exposing them to everything, and having them filter what to trust/believe/subscribe to.

On one hand, people (especially children) need to be protected from parts of the world. On the other hand, choosing which parts to protect them from instills them with the protector's own faults and biases.  This is likely to be an example of [traction](Traction.md).  On one end of the spectrum are things like meth.  On the other end are things like prejudice.

{Descartes had a quote about this, need to find it. Something along the lines of: the tradeoff between learning from others and avoiding internalizing their biases.}


### Opinions of others
The balance between following others' advice and blazing your own trail.

"I don't care what other people think."
- Taken literally, this is an extremist view, but it's usually used in the [current practice](Current practice.md) sense: as a critique on the status quo.
- It's naive to be so sure of your own beliefs that you ignore everyone else's.  On the other hand, being controlled by what others think will prevent you from doing good things that others dismiss.
