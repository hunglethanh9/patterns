The amortization of fixed costs.

Deduplication: fixed costs need only be paid once versus per-unit

If you double the number of machines, you double upfront costs, but also double throughput (all else being equal).  Therefore, capital recuperation time will be the same (ignoring interest), but after that, profits-per-time will be doubled.  Alternatively, marginal profit can be halved, lowering prices while keeping profits-per-time equal (but extending capital recuperation time).

Taking a static view (varying number of units instead of units per time), the average price per unit decreases with an increase in number of units.

Examples:
- goods become cheaper when mass produced
- buying in bulk
- efficiency of apartment complex vs house
- efficiency of city vs town (assuming equal per-capita consumption rates)
- fuel economy over (internal-combustion-engined) car speed
- squre-cube law: if maximizing volume / surface area
	- given equivalent total volume, a big cube has less surface area than two cubes
	- e.g. heating a building, ability of animals to stay warm or cool off
- context switching: each context switch has a fixed cost which needs to be amortized over the execution of the process switched to
	- factory lines
	- CPU process scheduling
	- automobile gear changes
