The amortization of fixed costs.

Deduplication: fixed costs need only be paid once versus per-unit

Examples:
- goods become cheaper when mass produced
- buying in bulk
- efficiency of apartment complex vs house
- efficiency of city vs town (assuming equal per-capita consumption rates)
- fuel economy over (internal-combustion-engined) car speed
- square-cube law (if maximizing volume / surface area)
	- given equivalent total volume, a big cube has less surface area than two smaller cubes
	- e.g. heating a building, ability of animals to stay warm or cool off
- context switching: each context switch has a fixed cost which needs to be amortized over the execution of the process switched to
	- changeover of factory lines
	- CPU process scheduling
	- shifting gears
- jumbo jet vs smaller airliners
- infrastructure-as-a-service: e.g. AWS is able to amortize the fixed costs of hardware across a large userbase
