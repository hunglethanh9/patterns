A la carte vs package  
Pay per ____ vs subscription

With package, some things "come along for the ride" that you would otherwise not value enough to get a la carte.

The tradeoffs involved are given by [abstraction-integration](Abstraction-integration.md).

Examples:
- vudu vs netflix
- contractor vacation (when paid hourly) vs employee vacation
- wage vs salary
- cable tv packages
- ideologies: picking and choosing individual ideas from multiple sources vs subscribing to ideologies wholesale
	- religions
	- political parties
	- books or other collections of ideas
	- musical genres or other categories
	- people: assigning people labels/categorizing them (See NGT's big think video about atheism)
- individual consumer, labor, etc unions vs government
- library vs framework
- oled vs lcd: with lcd, there's no attention paid to e.g. UI luminance because you're already "on the hook" for the full power expenditure, whereas oled uses less power the darker the image shownâ€”with oled, you pay for luminance a la carte
- highway tolls
