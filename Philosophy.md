### Guiding principles
- Good examples are key to learning. {maybe soften this a little}
	- Although communicating concepts abstractly has significant benefits, examples take advantage of people's considerable ability to learn through inductive inference.  So in addition to an abstract explanation, good examples are crucial {word}.
	- Learning is not only about internalizing a pattern, but also about being able to recognize the pattern in experience.  Examples help one make the connection between concept and reality.
- "Value-agnostic."  The goal of this framework is not to advocate, but to logically map premises to conclusions, requiring the user to apply this map to their own values.
- Knowledge isn't hierarchical, and neither should be its representations.

### Rationale {motivation}
- The organization and integration of existing knowledge is a constructive pursuit that will become increasingly important as the state of the art becomes increasingly specialized.
- Intuition already takes into account most or all of these patterns, often more precisely than is practical by "computing" them consciously.  However, when individuals disagree, intuition provides little recourse because the processes which lead to an intuitive belief are difficult to communicate.  Making these patterns explicit provides a language with which to reconcile conflicting intuitions, and may allow us to more easily recognize instances where intuition diverges from theory.
	- {Add to this: how intuition doesn't scale well with complexity}

### Caveats
- "No easy answers."  These are simple, general rules, but they can only be applied by taking into account the full complexity of a situation, which may include multiple levels and instances of interacting patterns, as well as complex inputs.
